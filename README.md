# 💎 Gold & Diamond Data Analysis — Crisis Behavior & Trends  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project analyzes **gold and diamond markets** using historical data, Python, and visualization. The focus is on how gold behaves as a **safe-haven asset during crises** and how diamonds compare in terms of pricing dynamics, volatility, and seasonality. By examining **major economic downturns (2001–2003, 2008–2011, 2020–2021)** and market cycles, the analysis reveals both expected patterns (gold’s resilience) and surprising insights (diamonds’ muted, consumer-driven trends).

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used  

- **Python (Pandas & NumPy)**  
  Used extensively for data wrangling, time-series transformations, calculating moving averages, rolling volatility, and aggregating returns across different periods.  

- **Matplotlib**  
  Created custom visualizations, trend lines, seasonal plots, and volatility charts to make the insights more interpretable.  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Included outlier detection, missing value checks, moving average smoothing, and seasonal pattern exploration to uncover hidden behaviors.  

- **Financial & Market Analysis**  
  Focused on gold’s role as a safe-haven asset vs. diamonds as consumer-driven commodities, with emphasis on crisis comparisons, volatility tracking, and floor-building behavior.  

- **Operating System (OS) Module**  
  Managed dataset imports, file handling, and ensured clean project structuring for reproducibility.  

- **Jupyter Notebook**  
  Served as the main environment for iterative analysis, combining code, visuals, and insights into a cohesive narrative.  

- **Data Storytelling**  
  Translated raw numbers into insights that align with real-world market behavior, cultural demand cycles, and crisis-period decision-making.

## 📉 Key Insights  

### Gold  
- **Safe-Haven Behavior** – Gold consistently surged during crises:  
  - Dot-com Bust (2001–2003): **+1.18% avg monthly return**  
  - Global Financial Crisis (2008–2011): **+1.62% avg monthly return**  
  - COVID-19 Pandemic (2020–2021): **+3.19% avg monthly return**  
- **Volatility & Floors** – Each crisis built a new long-term price floor, though exceptions like the 2012 correction show temporary overvaluation before stabilization.  
- **Seasonality** – Stronger average gains in **January** and **August**, aligning with cultural demand cycles in India and China.  

### Diamonds  
- **Stability Over Surges** – Diamond prices showed **muted crisis reactions**, reflecting consumer-driven dynamics rather than financial safe-haven behavior.  
- **Long-Term Growth** – Gradual appreciation over decades, but without the sharp spikes seen in gold.  
- **Demand-Driven Seasonality** – Peaks tied more to **luxury consumption and weddings** than to global macroeconomic shocks.

## 📚 What I Learned  

- How to compare **financial safe-haven assets** (gold) with **consumer luxury markets** (diamonds)  
- Techniques for handling **time-series volatility** and calculating rolling averages  
- Importance of **crisis-specific analysis** instead of just long-term growth trends  
- How cultural and seasonal cycles shape commodity demand differently  

---

## 🧠 Future Improvements  

- Add **diamond market segmentation** (e.g., size, quality, lab-grown vs natural)  
- Expand gold analysis with **correlations to inflation and equity markets**  
- Build an **interactive dashboard** (Power BI or Plotly Dash) for real-time scenario exploration  
- Forecast **long-term price floors** using ARIMA or Prophet models
